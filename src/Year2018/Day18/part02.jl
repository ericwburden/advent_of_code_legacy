Given the input as a character matrix, convert it to a landscape and
simulate changes in the landscape until a cycle is observed. With the
knowledge of the state of the landscape at the start of the cycle and
the length of the cycle, we can determine which state the landscape
will be in after the 1,000,000,000th minute and return the resource
value of that state.
