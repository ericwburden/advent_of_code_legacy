"""
    part2(input)

Given the input as a tuple containing the initial program state and list of
instructions, run the program until it halts, and record the value stored in
`MAGIC_REGISTER`. Restart the program, running it until it halts again,
continuing this process and recording the value that halts the program each
time until a repeating value is found. Return the last unique value that 
halts the program. 

NOTE: This process is >>SLOW<<. I should probably reverse engineer the ElfCode
and re-write it in Julia, but as of the moment I have completed this puzzle, I
don't feel like it. The function will complete, but it takes a couple of
minutes.
