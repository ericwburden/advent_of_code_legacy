Spin up 50 network computers and run the network, passing packets round robin
style. Every time a packet is sent to address `255`, if the network is otherwise
idle, check the packet to see if it's `y` value has been seen before. If so, 
return it, otherwise pass the packet to the computer at address `0` to kick
the network back into action.
