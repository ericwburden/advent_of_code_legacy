Calculate the value at a given row/column index based on the process
described in the puzzle. The process described in the text is essentially
[modular exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation),
where the sequence with which the value is placed into the list serves as 
the exponent, reduced by one to account for 0-indexing vs 1-indexing. The 
other values used in this calculation are given.
