# I came to this number by checking the presents/house number ratio for a 
# variety of houses in the 100-400 range, noting that this ratio tended to 
# hover around 23. To give some margin for error, I decided to divide the 
# `INPUT` by 20 and check that, which seemed plenty large enough. This was
# borne out by the results :D

Given the input as a number representing a minimum number of presents to 
deliver, identify the lowest house number that will recieve _at least_ `input`
presents. The number of presents delivered by each elf is as described in the
puzzle input. This function uses a version of a *Sieve of Erastosthenes* to
calculate the number of presents delivered to each house in the range.
