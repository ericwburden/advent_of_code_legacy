Given the input as a list of numbers, return the sum of all numbers where
the number is the same as the number that occurs exactly `n` numbers after it, 
where `n` is half the length of the input vector. Numbers in the second half
of the input are compared to numbers in the first half, as if the input vector
"wrapped around".
