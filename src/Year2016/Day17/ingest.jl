| Although the input for today's puzzle is a single string, we're going to
| need a data structure to represent the floor map of fixed walls and doors.
| We'll represent each room as a 4-bit value, where 1's represent walls and 
| 0's represent doors, in the order up, down, left, right. For example, 
| `1001`, or `9`, will represent the top-left corner.

walls and closed doors as 1's in the same pattern as the floor map: up, down,
